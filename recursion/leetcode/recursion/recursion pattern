1) binary tree search pattern

one of the pattern we discovered is how to search efficiently when we are able to create a binary tree
example:
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-kth-bit-in-nth-binary-string/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=recursion&favoriteSlug=&difficulty=MEDIUM
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=recursion&favoriteSlug=&difficulty=MEDIUM

2) We have another pattern of fibonacci series

306. Additive numbers - https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=backtracking&difficulty=MEDIUM
842. Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence - https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-fibonacci-sequence/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=backtracking&difficulty=MEDIUM

3) Permutation variation

1079 Letter Tile possibilities - https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-tile-possibilities/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=backtracking&difficulty=MEDIUM
This is a variation of permutation where chars in any order is possible
